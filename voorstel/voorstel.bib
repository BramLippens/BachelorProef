  abstract    = {Game engines are platforms that make it easier to create computer games. They allow you to integrate and combine into single unit individual game elements such as animations, interaction with the user, or detection of collisions between objects. Game engine is a software that facilitates the production of games for platforms such as desktops, consoles, and mobile devices [1]. In addition to specialized editors, game engines provide ready-made functionalities that can be used by users. A great advantage of using the game engine is the possibility of their reuse. Game engines are an example of software isolating rigid logic and game rules, from easily modifiable and expandable components, which can be used repeatedly in a way that does not require great modifications. This article is an attempt to perform a comparative analysis of three engines to create games: CryEngine, Unreal Engine, and Unity. The criteria for comparison will be technical capabilities and factors influencing the popularity and acceptance of engines by users. The aim of this article is to show the strengths and weaknesses of engines and to present the differences between these tools.},

for the better conception of the people allied with the IT sector. The main audience targeted in this paper are those 
who are from a non-technical and technical background and due to the augmentation of technology, they want to 
pursue their careers in game development. Moreover, in this paper, qualitative research methods have been adopted. 
It is found that Unity is a smart and active game development platform that is playing an operative role nowadays. 
Different industries are inspired by Unity that may impact positively such as in career growth, job opportunities, 
and in other regards. Unity comes with many benefits; it is an easy and simple platform to learn game development 
and is a powerful tool that is preferred by professionals.},

  title       = {Game developer experience: A cognitive task analysis with different game engines},
  type        = {techreport},
  abstract    = {Context: Today there are a lot of different kinds of game engines to choose from, but is
one of these engines more suitable for a developer with a beginners’ experience in game
development?
Objective: This is something we explore in order to help teachers choose a suitable engine for teaching game development to beginners. In this study, two teams of two persons
each compare two of these engines, Godot and Unity.
Method: We conducted a study, consisting of six iterations, to observe the development
of a prototype game using the two engines. We collected data during the development
of the game using a think-aloud protocol and a questionnaire, and after the development
using a questionnaire that included the SUS scale for assessing the overall usability of the
game engines.
Results: The Godot engine have been focused on completing their documentation and
the documentation is somewhat directed to more experienced developers. In comparison
the Unity engine got more solutions outside of the documentation and also got their own
special guides towards beginners.
Although Godot engine got a more simpler GUI which will be easier at first but as the
tasks became more difficult this became more of a disadvantage and some solutions were
not found easily among the documentation. In comparison the Unity engine got more
menus and can seem a lot to a beginner but became to be more helpful the harder the
tasks became and even though most solutions were not found among the documentation,
there were enough information from other sources to solve all problems with an easy
search.
Neither of the engines provided with a lot of helpful information within the tool, although
the Godot engine had some cases where the tool would let the developers know a certain
component was needed.
Conclusion: Our main conclusion is that Godot is a good entry point into game development but as the tasks gets more difficult students would need the teacher’s help in order
to solve the tasks as easy as with Unity. In contrast, Unity starts more difficult but as
tasks gets more difficult Unity have more solutions online, which makes it more suitable
if students are to develop on their own.
This study is rather small with only four participants and this limits the results, for future
studies it would be best to have more participants},

  abstract    = {Unity (commonly known as Unity3D) is a game engine and integrated development
environment (IDE) for creating interactive media, typically video games. As CEO David
Helgason put it, Unity “is a toolset used to build games, and it’s the technology that executes the
graphics, the audio, the physics, the interactions, [and] the networking.” [1] Unity is famous for
its fast prototyping capabilities and large number of publishing targets.
The first version of Unity (1.0.0) was created by colleagues: David Helgason, Joachim
Ante and Nicholas Francis in Denmark. [1] The initial product launched on June 6, 2005. [2] The
goal was to create an affordable game engine with professional tools for amateur game
developers while “democratize[ing the] game development” industry.[3] The three were inspired
by the easy workflow, simple asset pipeline, and drag-and-drop interface of Apple’s Final Cut
Pro product.[1] When originally released, Unity was available solely for Mac OS X, and
developers could only deploy their creations to a few platforms. The current version (4.3.1 as of
this writing) is supported on both Windows and Mac OS X, and offers at least a dozen target
platforms. Publishing 64-bit executables has been possible in Unity for a long time, but a 64-bit
version of the Editor is not yet available, though highly anticipated from the development
community.},
